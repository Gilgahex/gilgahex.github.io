Correlations to Intelligence?

Meditation

​	Zen - Watcher technique

​	Don't associate the self with any given thought that bubbles into your conscious awareness

​	Your mind is a well spring, but you choose when to drink.

​	By not fixating on any given thought that occurs and separating yourself from 

​	I often think of it as I am merely hearing or watching the thoughts of a stranger as I meditate

​	After a while the internal chatter dies down 

​	Another method that helps is to simply focus on your external senses, and as Alan Watts puts it, "Listen to all the sounds of the external world as closely as you would a piece of Beethoven"
