## Photoacoustics



## Neural Dust

An article about photo-acoustics would be remiss without some mention of neural dust.

Neural dust is a hypothetical in-vivo neuro-implant technology, which together with neurolace are the two major players in next-gen neural implants.

Neural dust *, like a million antennae all signaling out what's happening in your brain, and potentially taking in RF information, where you could have millimeter scale I/O channel, and potentially an even
