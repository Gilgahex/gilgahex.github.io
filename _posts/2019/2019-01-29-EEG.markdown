## Photonic Electrodes

![Photrode](https://ai2-s2-public.s3.amazonaws.com/figures/2017-08-08/ef4056917a3059705d6cb27eb74df642b038993a/2-Figure2-1.png)

I've been researching how to remotely sense EEG and other biopotentials. It seems to me that measuring EEG with Gold Electrodes, Ag/AgCl, 1020 Paste and the like is archaic and hasn't been changed or improved for the last 50 years.

On a long business trip, I was reading an article on neuroscience in a SMOG shop in the middle of Oregon. 

It occurred to me that there was no reason why you had to use metal electrodes to measure the brain or any other part of the body.

Because of how Light and Electromagnetism (EM) interact (thanks Maxwell), you can measure electrical or magnetic effects through the use of Light in certain special materials.

Light and EM are fundamentally two pieces of the same whole (QED), so it was apparent to me that the electrical activity of a certain region of the brain would interact with any light that passes by it and leave an imprint, a shadow in its wake.

Imagine you see a small rippling wave riding along a huge swell. The huge swell is the beam of light you send in close proximity to your brain and the small rippling wave is your brain's internal electrical activity.

Then you could infer your brain activity by simple measuring how the large wave seems to oscillate every so slightly. After many months of researching this topic I came across exactly what I needed to build such a device.

Electro-Optical effects like the [Kerr effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_effect) and [Pockel's Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pockels_effect) allow for such an interaction to be readily measured.

Because of non-linearities of many materials, higher order terms of these interactions between matter and light become manifest.

Using a Mach-Zedner Modulator (MZM), you can convert the phase change of the incident light into an overall reduction of intensity

For LiNbO3 Pockel's Effect is dominant over the Kerr Effect so we get change in the index of refraction which is linear in the Electric Field.

Over at SRICO they those to use Telecommuications frequencies, in their paper they mention using 1550nm which is a standard C-Band frequency used for fiber-optic communication.

Going through the math a bit,

$\Delta n =-\lambda \hat K \nabla V$

$\Delta_{OPL} =  \Delta n *s$

Where s is the optical path through the crystal.

$\delta\phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta_{OPL}$

$\delta \phi = -2\pi  \hat K \nabla V s= -2\pi  \hat K \frac{V}{D} s$

Since it's just the Voltage between the gold electrodes,

$\nabla V = \frac{V}{D}$ 

Where V is the bio-potential in question and D is the distance between the electrodes of the MZM

Then the intensity will modulate with the phase change caused by the difference in electrical potential between the electrodes placed on the skin.

$I = I_0 + I_1 + 2\sqrt{I_0I_1\cos({\delta\phi})}$

It's possible to measure any biopotential this way, EMG, EEG, EKG, EOG, etc.

Materials like [LiNbO3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_niobate) and LiTaO3 have the potential to finely measure our biopotentials from only skin contact because of their sizable electro-optical constants $\hat K$ .

In fact, our biopotentials can be measured remotely as well because the Electric Field's of any biopotential extends beyond the skin.

Work in using light as a transfer medium for electro-physiological signals was carried out by SRICO in 2004 as part of an Army research program, they trademarked it as the Photrode.

However, it appears that this amazing technology never went anywhere and further developments were stopped shortly after the project concluded. Its scientific legacy is only known by two patents, one has lapsed and the other will lapse in a few years.

Unfortunately this happens all the time, a company or subcontractor may have an amazing new technology they have developed and get initial funding for a Phase I of a project, but that technology may never see the light of day and become commercialized because of nothing more than lack of funding, which is usually political or dependent on other extraneous factors wholly not related to the merit of the technology itself.

I see no reason why this promising technology shouldn't be funded and picked back up, it would allow for a much better clinical experience while measuring EEG.

Because of its remote capabilities, no conducting paste would be necessary. 

No exfoliation of the scalp would be necessary.

EEG would become a more routine procedure in medicine.

This would be great for machine learning models in neuroscience because of the wealth of data that would become available with increased EEG data.

I imagine it would become a standard piece of equipment for any clinic, not just for psychologists especially if you could micronize it.

Potentially such equipment could even readily used in ambulances as a diagnostic tool. Setup would be a breeze because all you would have to do is turn on the light source and place the sensor on the patients head.

Training cost for EEG technicians would be lower. They could focus on the interpretation of the EEG data and have more time to employ robust qEEG methods. The entire process of retrieving EEG data would be sped up by at least a factor of 30X.

Currently it takes about 20-30 minutes for a technician to setup a patient. Setup could only take seconds so daily EEG would not be a chore and would become a real possibility.

This opens doors of which beyond are unknown bounties that will benefit the fields of neuroscience and medicine immensely.

## Ultra High Impedence (UHI) Electrodes 

A similar technology using ultra high impedence sensors also exists.

Things like the [EPIC Sensor](http://www.plesseysemiconductors.com/products/epic-sensing-technology/) from Plessey Semiconductor seem to me the right direction for the future of biosensing technology.

These types of sensors can also remotely pickup any sort of electrophysiological signal, EEG, EMG, EOG, etc.

Unfortunately Plessey's solution is both costly and requires extra equipment to setup. I only came across them because of my own research and curiosity. The barrier to entry for a neuroscience lab starting out would most likely be too high for this technology.

Only large established labs that are willing to try something new, beyond the pale would even attempt to create protocols  with this hardware.

It would require a cross disciplinary effort from someone with electrical engineering knowledge to integrate this new hardware into existing neuroscience labs.

Honestly, I'm not sure why everyone is still only measuring the voltage at every site and not the actual E-Field, you're losing so much information by only considering the Voltage.

Important questions like the [physical nature of consciousness](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/2/eaat7603/tab-pdf) are in the dynamics of the system, that is the movement of ions and charge within the structure. It's in the pattern, not the absolute value of the potential at any given point.

## RF Electrodes

I've had this idea for a while to use [Ambient Backscatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_backscatter) for I/O off of an electrode.

It should then be possible to create a wireless electrode which is selectively active to only certain RF frequencies.

It operates on a similar macro-principle as that behind the Photonic Electrode. The incident RF wave briefly powers some biosensor and physically encodes what biopotential it sensed into the reflected RF wave.

Research has been done into this and is feasible according to an article back in 2013, [Battery-Free Multichannel Digital ECGBiotelemetry using UHF RFID Techniques](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6548130).

Wherein, they provide a schematic for a telemetry chip that does just what I was thinking using RFID, the architecture runs off of an RF harvester instead of a battery.

*The telemetry device employs an on-chip RF power harvester, consisting of a 4-stage Schottky diode voltage multiplier*

So this RF harvester could be ambiently powered by the RF that exists in a modern city or selectively powered by some keyed pulse.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4649107

These type of RF electrodes also seems to be a potential communication interface for the idea of [Neural Dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_dust#Backscatter_Communication)
