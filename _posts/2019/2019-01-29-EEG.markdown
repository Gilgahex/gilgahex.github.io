I've been researching how to remotely sense EEG and other biopotentials. 

It seems to me that measuring EEG with Gold Electrodes, Ag/AgCl, 1020 Paste and the like is archiac and hasn't been changed or improved for the last 50 years.

Materials like LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 have the potential to finely measure our biopotentials from only skin contact.

Things like the [EPIC Sensor](http://www.plesseysemiconductors.com/products/epic-sensing-technology/) from Plessey Semiconductor seem to me the right direction for the future of EEG technology.

Honestly, I'm not sure why everyone is still only measurig the voltage at every site and not the actual E-Field, you're losing so much information by only considering the Voltage from a reference.

Instead, imagine if
