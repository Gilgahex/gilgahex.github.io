Beyond The Standard Model: 


Let's start by discussing the [Schwinger Limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_limit), which may or may not be as exciting as it sounds.

Where energy densities beyond this limit create a spacetime state, called a hernia in spacetime by [Ian O'Neill](https://web.archive.org/web/20111103183635/http://news.discovery.com/space/a-laser-to-rip-apart-spacetime-create-ghosts-111102.html)

I wrote a proposal as an undergrad on how it maybe possible to use the * being built in * as a probe into light fields of these extreme intensities.

The big idea is as follows *
