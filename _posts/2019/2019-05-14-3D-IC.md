## 

The future of computing architecture must be 3D, the extent of Moore's Law is near its end for 2D architectures.

This is why we're seeing Intel move to a "Chiplet" architecture with their Foveros Packaging for Lakefield and Sunny Cove.

We saw Intel make [3D transistors in 2011](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/standards-22nm-3d-tri-gate-transistors-presentation.html) with their of 22nm 3D Tri-gate and the emergence of a 3D based RAM technology [3DXpoint Optane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_XPoint) in 2015, Foveros 3D is the natural extension of this idea to a higher order computing structure, a SoC.

But the emergence of fully integrated 3D ICs has yet to come manifest in a meaningful way. Most architectures built around 3D ICs are [experimental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_integrated_circuit#Notable_3D_chips).

Another technology that I'm eager to see developed is [Atomic Switches](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-brain-built-from-atomic-switches-can-learn-20170920/), so far the Ag/Ag<sub>2</sub> switches that have been made naturally grow in neuromorphic systems with long nanowire tendrils which behave similar to the human brain's own synapses.

Although this technology is still very early and in the research phase of development, in principle it could be a very powerful 3D computing technology.

It has resilience baked in, if you fry a synapse it's not like frying a trace of an analog circuit.

*When Gimzewski and Stieg told others about their project, almost  nobody thought it would work. Some said the device would show one type of static activity and then sit there, Stieg recalled. Others guessed the opposite: “They said the switching would cascade and the whole thing would just burn out,” Gimzewski said.*

*But the device did not melt. Rather, as Gimzewski and Stieg observed  through an infrared camera, the input current kept changing the paths it  followed through the device — proof that activity in the network was  not localized but rather distributed, as it is in the brain.* - 

Its computational ability is not localized to any one synapse, its distributed across the entire system like the human brain, a type of morphic computing, the computing becomes structural and fuzzier.

The traces of the system are dynamic and change with the parameters they are subject to.

I could see this type of technology being used in the datacenters of the future, where the data that is being encoded and transformed is constantly being optimized.

It would be like having a morphable ASIC, a step beyond FPGAs where the atomic structure of the hardware itself would be reprogrammable and could change depending on demand.

If this technology can be tuned in such a way to control the structure and spontaneous formation of these 3D synapses then computation and storaged based on neuromorphic silver.

Definitely a technology to keep an eye on.
