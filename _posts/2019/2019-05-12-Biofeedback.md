## Biofeedback

Think back to when you learned how to drive a car or ride a bike

You take in visual and audio input from the world and train the muscles in your legs and arms to operate the car or bike.

This form of feedback where you form a feedback loop with your own senses is called Biofeedback.

It turns out you can train such more than just the muscles in your limbs, biofeedback when focused on your heart and brain can impart health benefits.

Biofeedback has a bad rap in the scientific community because of its cultural proximity to New-Age Charlatans.

The type that'll try to sell you a Salt Lamp claiming that the ["Ions"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ--scjcAZ4) will help your Aura.

Weirdly enough they'd be half right, there is a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23320516) that shows that Negative Ions are associated with a higher Alpha Wave brain state, and the opposite for Positive Ions, albeit with a small sample size, N=20.

A further meta-analysis showed that across many studies, nothing conclusive could be drawn about the affect of either positive or negative ions.

But we're not here to talk about Ions, what about Biofeedback?

Full disclosure, I'm of the opinion that there's a "Diamond in the Rough" in regards to Biofeedback techniques.

I'm less certain about neurofeedback techniques because of the complexity of the brain, but for Heart Based Biofeedback like Heart Rate Variability training I'm rather convinced of its efficacy.

To directly cite the [Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback](http://downloads.imune.net/medicalbooks/Evidence_Based_Practice_in_Biofeedback_and_Neurofeedback_2008_0_8_26_2011_9_15_24_AM_0_.pdf) (AAPB) for some context

"On the other hand, several reports of unsuccessful biofeedback training have appeared in the research literature since the inception of biofeedback training three decades ago. Many of the unsuccessful studies conducted in the early development of the field reflect failure to thoroughly train patients. For example, some unsuccessful studies provided only minimal training with the biofeedback instrumentation (often one to four sessions of short duration), provided little coaching, involved no home practice, and failed to train to clinical criteria."

Now then, what evidence is there for the health benefits of Biofeedback?

From those articles we see that

Breath Exercises

Here you can see a short demo of [Anahata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7uqHDCeC20) a wireless Biofeedback device.

Now onto murkier waters.

## Neurofeedback

One idea I had was, would it be possible to train yourself to more optimally operate a BCI if you could train your SMR response by mental repetition of certain muscle groups and use that trained response as a robust signal for BCI.

A study showing that Pianists who simply think about practicing a piece actually perform that piece significantly better than the control, those who did not do this mental practice.

And you can actually see the brain firing differently while this mental practice is going on, the motor cortex is being activated.
