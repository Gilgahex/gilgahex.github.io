Recently Telsa acquired Maxwell Technologies.

This is a smart move because of the Ultracapacitor technology that Maxwell has developed.

Let's talk about what puts the Ultra on Ultracapacitor

Normally capacitors hold something around * 

An Ultracapacitor will have a capacitance one or two orders of magnitude larger.

To review to store some amount of charge Q at Voltage V, it requires a C of the following

{%raw%}

Q = C_1 V_1 = C_ULTRA V_ULTRA 

\frac{V_ULTRA}{V_1} = \frac{C_1}{C_ULTRA}

{%endraw%}

Where C is the capacitance in question.

So to discharge some charge Q it will require only a few percent the original capacitor's voltage.
